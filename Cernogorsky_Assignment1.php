    <h2> Why am I working with PHP? </h2>
      <h3> PHP has been afluent for decades</h3>
        <p>
      PHP is a language that was devised in the mid to late 90's. By the beginning of the 20th century, PHP took up a majority of backend web development. PHP being a server-side scripted language does make it specific to it's task, it is an extremely robust and dynamically typed.
        </p>
      <h3> PHP is surprisingly easy to learn </h3>
        <p>
      Despite what many may believe, PHP is not difficult to learn. PHP is a language that is easy to learn and use. PHP being a weak-typed language can be applying to some. However, overreliance on this can make one a weak programmer, in the long run.
        </p>
      <h3> PHP is extremely customizable </h3>
        <p>
          Whether you want to make a small webpage or a large webpage, PHP is a good go-to, for the same purpose that it is a swiss-army knife. PHP can be used with many variations of SQL, including, but not limited to: Mysql, Postgres, Sqlite, and Sqlserver. PHP can also be used with many other languages, such as Javascript, and in direct conjuncture with HTML.
